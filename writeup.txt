This challenge is based on the classic IND-CPA game. The goal is to demonstrate that for our scheme, ElGamal in Zp*, the scheme is not IND-CPA secure.
While for Elliptic Curve groups the scheme is IND-CPA secure, for Zp*, it is proven that the legendre symbol is the same for a message and its ciphertext.
We can compute the legendre symbol for a with respect to p in python with:

```
def legendre(a,p):
    leg = pow(a,(p-1)//2, p)
    if leg == p-1:
        return -1
    else:
        return leg

```
Note that the game gives us p, which makes this approach valid.

Then, it is just a matter of choosing m0 and m1 such that one is a square(legendre returns 1) and one is a non-square(legendre returns -1).
We use "1" and "3" as our chosen plaintexts(ascii 49, which is a square, and ascii 51 which is non square).
Then, for each round of the game, we simply compute legendre of the second number in the ciphertext pair, which should correspond to either m0 or m1.
We do this 20 times, since the game says that we must get the answer right 20 times to win, and we get the flag.
